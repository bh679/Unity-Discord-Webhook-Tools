How to make a webhook link:
1 - Make new channels for the webhooks (a dev one and default)

2 - Make the webbooks that point to each
Discord/ServerSettings/Intergrations/Create Webhook

3 - Save webhooks in TextAsset files in PRIVATE (so they do not sync with public version control)

4 - Add Discord Logging prefab to scene
 - Reference the webhook text assets
